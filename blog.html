          In communications and information processing, code is a system of
          rules to convert information—such as a letter, word, sound, image, or
          gesture—into another form, sometimes shortened or secret, for
          communication through a communication channel or storage in a storage
          medium. An early example is the invention of language, which enabled a
          person, through speech, to communicate what they thought, saw, heard
          or felt to others. But speech limits the range of communication to the
          distance a voice can carry, and limits the audience to those present
          when the speech is uttered . The invention of writing, which converted
          spoken language into visual symbols, extended the range of
          communication across space and time. The process of encoding converts
          information from a source into symbols for communication or storage.
          Decoding is the reverse process, converting code symbols back into a
          form that the recipient understands, such as English or/and Spanish.
          One reason for coding is to enable communication in places where
          ordinary plain language, spoken or written, is difficult or
          impossible. For example, semaphore, where the configuration of flags
          held by a signaler or the arms of a semaphore tower encodes parts of
          the message, typically individual letters and numbers. Another person
          standing a great distance away can interpret the flags and reproduce
          the words sent. In communications and information processing, code is
